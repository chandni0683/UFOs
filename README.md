# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we will add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
To get the results first we modified our code in index.html file by creating more table filters. We added filters for city, state, country, and shape, as shown in the following image:

We created Javascript functions in the app.js file to build the table , then fetch the data from the filter values selected so that the table can be filtered as per the preference. A webpage was created with the help of Bootstrap. Then changes were made to style.css file to make the adjustments in the font color and background image.

If we filter the data by selecting values for Sandiego city following image appears:

When we change any of the values like we changed the shape to triangle the result changes.

## Summary
One drawback of this design is that the title field is blurr and "The truth is out there" is not very visible.
I would change the font color for the above title as well as add some images to the page to make it look better.
